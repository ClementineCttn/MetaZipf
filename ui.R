            has been an on-going subject of scientific discussion for a century. Despite hundreds of empirical evidences, it is still not clear if there is a universal
            Zipf's law,  - i.e. a power law relating city population to their rank in the system, with a exponent equal to 1 -, because in many cases, a value significantly different
from 1 is measured. Comparative papers (Singer, 1936; Rosen, Resnick, 1980; Parr, 1985; Soo, 2005) and meta analyses (Nitsch, 2005) provide a first idea of the magnitude of this variation and they try to
understand why deviations are observed: is it because this law simply does not apply in some countries (where control over migration is strong for example)? 
            Is it because the system is not consistently defined (Cristelli et al., 2012), in terms of territory, city definition, etc.?
