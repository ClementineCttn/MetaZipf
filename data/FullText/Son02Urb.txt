Over the past two decades, China has experienced rapid urban growth. The non- agricultural population in urban areas increased from 172 million in 1978 to 389 million in 1999 (NBS, 1994, 2000), a 126 per cent increase. This growth rate is much greater than the national population growth rate of 31 per cent between 1980 and 1999. As a result, China has become more urbanised, with an urban population share that has increased from 18 per cent in 1978 to 31 per cent in 1999. Rapid urbanisation can be also observed by the increase in the number of cities. Chinese cities are administrative entities and officially designated according to political status, economic development level and total population. In 1980, China had 223 cities, with 15 having a population size over 1 million. In 1999, China had 667 cities, with 37 having a population size over 1 million (NBS, 2000). Naturally, urbanisation in China and China’s urban system have formed an important area for research. 
Previous studies of the size, growth and distribution of cities have been mostly based on Western economies. Generally, these studies have concluded that cities grow to take advantage of scale and agglomeration economies in production, consumption and distribution. In a market economy, a free flow of labour, capital and goods in trade is also assumed to allow processes to operate and to permit choice among various locations. These choices lead to regional specialisation, competition and variable growth rates of cities in a system. Governments also intervene directly in the evolution of urban systems. Such intervention may take the form of state investments in transport and urban infrastructure in order to correct market failure in economically viable locations or to influence an industrial or commercial location through favouritism. 
Among the many theories advanced to explain city sizes, the growth dynamics of cities and the distribution of population across cities, the Pareto law, as discussed in section 2, have been most popular. Empirically, the Pareto law has been proved a very accurate description of city size distributions in many different countries and at different times within a country (Rosen and Resnick, 1980; Mills and Hamilton, 1994; Fujita et al., 1999). Theoretically, however, this law has received much criticism due to the lack of consistent and well-defined explanations of the processes that govern city size distributions. Several studies have argued the case for hierarchical city systems (Henderson, 1988; Fujita et al., 1999), but none of them has proved that the hierarchy should follow the Pareto law. 
China has been a socialist economy since 1949. Its city system is unique, large and complex. However, few studies have investigated the size, growth and distribution of Chinese cities (Fan, 1999). This paper has three purposes. First, it examines China’s urbanisation and the evolution of its city system. The paper shows that urbanisation in China has experienced three phrases since the People’s Republic of China was founded in 1949 and the number of cities has increased greatly, especially during the past two decades. Secondly, the paper uses 1991 and 1998 city-level data and applies the Pareto law to investigate the size distributions of Chinese cities and the changes in China’s city system. It finds that the size distribution of Chinese cities became flatter—i.e. cities became more even in size, during the 1990s. Thirdly, the paper discusses how economic and institutional factors affect the patterns of city growth and the urban system. It argues that both economic and institutional factors are important in explaining China’s city system. 
This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the Pareto law of city size distributions and reviews the literature on this topic. Section 3 summarises facts of urbanisation in China and the evolution of China’s city system. Section 4 estimates the parameters of the Pareto law and a generalisation of it using 1991 and 1998 city-level data, in order to examine the Pareto or non-Pareto 
behaviour of Chinese city systems and changes in the system. In section 5, this paper argues that in China both the market and the government play active roles in shaping the urban system. Section 6 provides conclusions. 
The Pareto law for city size distribution can be written as 
where, G is the number of cities with population P or more; P is the population of the ith largest city, A is a constant, and a is the Pareto exponent. 
When, the Pareto law becomes the so-called rank–size rule. In this case, the product of a city’s rank and population is a constant equal to the population of the largest city, also indicating that the third-largest city is one-third the size of the largest, and so on. When, populations of cities far down in the size distribution are greater (less) than is predicted by the rank– size rule, indicating a more (less) even distribution of city sizes. For example, the rank–size rule predicts that the population of the second-largest city would be half that of the largest city, while when a the Pareto law predicts that the population of the second-largest city would be 56 per cent that of the largest city. Thus, the Pareto exponent measures how evenly city sizes are distributed. 
There is an extensive literature on application of the Pareto law to city size distributions (for example, Rosen and Resnick, 1980; Parr, 1985; Fan, 1988). Reviewing the literature, several important observations can be made. First, the Pareto law provides a very accurate description of city size distributions in many different countries and at many different times in history. For instance, Rosen and Resnick (1980) used data from 44 countries and found that the R value was above 0.95 for 36 countries while only Thailand had an R value lower than 0.9 (0.83). 
Secondly, the Pareto law gives a simple way to examine changes in city size distribution over time for a given country and to compare size distributions across countries. Previous studies (for example, Parr, 1985; Guerin-Pace, 1995) have shown that the Pareto exponent exhibits a U-shaped pattern over time. Rosen and Resnick (1980) found that the Pareto exponent tends to be higher for populous countries, suggesting that populous countries tend to have more evenly distributed populations. 
Thirdly, there is no general agreement as to whether the Pareto exponent is elastic, unitary or inelastic across nations or even in a given country. In fact, estimates of the Pareto exponent vary for different studies, due to different sample sizes, different cut-offs in the low end of distributions and using city-proper or SMSA or urbanised area data. For instance, the mean Pareto exponent for 44 countries in Rosen and Resnick (1980) was 1.136 and the standard deviation was 0.196. For the US in particular, Rosen and Resnick (1980) gave an estimate of 1.000 for 1970 metropolitan population data, 1.184 for city-proper data and 1.310 for data on the 50 largest cities in the US. Parr (1985) used US city-proper data and reported estimated exponents ranging from 1.066 to 1.147 during 1895– 1981. 
Fourthly, there is no theoretical reason to expect the Pareto law to hold with precision for city size distribution, although a number of studies have theoretically derived a hierarchy in the urban system (for example, Henderson, 1988; Fujita et al., 1999). As these studies have emphasised, there is a tension between external economies associated with the geographical concentration of industry within a city, on the one side, and diseconomies such as congestion costs associated with large cities, on the other. The net effect of this tension determines the optimal size of a given city. A hierarchy in the city system emerges because external economies tend to be specific to particular industries and hence vary greatly across industries, but diseconomies tend to depend on the overall size of a city. However, none of the previous studies has proved that the hierarchy should follow the Pareto law or the rank–size rule. Fujita et al. state that 
The regularity of the urban size distribution poses a real puzzle, one that neither our approach nor the most plausible alternative approach to city sizes seems to answer (Fujita et al., 1999, p. 219). 
They further state that “we hope that future research will resolve this puzzle” (p. 225). 
Urbanisation in China has experienced three phrases since the PRC was founded in 1949. In the first phrase (1952– 65), China emphasised the growth of heavy industries. With this development strategy, many rural workers were recruited in state-owned enterprises and industrial cities were developed, especially in the inland areas. During this period, urban population increased faster than the national population and China experienced a steady rate of urbanisation. Table 1 shows that the urban population increased from 71.6 million in 1952 to 130.5 million in 1965, an 82 per cent increase. During the same period, the pace of national population growth was slower, from 574.8 million to 725.4 million, a 26 per cent increase. As a result, the urban population share increased from 12.5 per cent in 1952 to 18 per cent in 1965 (NBS, 1994). 
The second phrase was during the Cultural Revolution (1966– 77). In this period, urban growth was either negative or static. A major reason was the policy that required millions of urban youth to go to rural areas in order to ‘undergo peasants’ education’, which Mao thought important to prevent the younger generation from accepting capitalist influences and to channel and cultivate new revolutionary successors. In 1966– 77, 17 million urban people were resettled in the countryside for political reasons and due to the worsening situation with respect to housing shortages, job opportunities and urban infrastructure (Song and Timberlake, 1996). 
As shown in Table 1, the growth rate of the national population was higher than that of the urban population between 1965 and 1975. In consequence, the urban population share stagnated, being 18 per cent in both 1965 and 1978 (NBS, 1994). 
The third phrase is of rapid urbanisation in the reform era (1978– present). Since 1978, China has not only promoted an open-door policy and a ‘socialist market economy’ but has also encouraged urbanisation. Many county towns (xian-zhen) have been upgraded and classified as cities. The number of cities increased dramatically from 191 in 1978 to 667 in 1999 and the urban population share increased from 18 per cent to 31 per cent, respectively (NBS, 2000, pp. 95 and 347). As shown in Table 1, it took China 26 years from 1952 to 1978 to have a 5.5 per cent increase in urbanisation, while it took 
only 21 years from 1978 to 1999 to have a 13 per cent increase in urbanisation. Without doubt, China has experienced a faster rate of urbanisation in the past two decades. 
In China, cities are classified into three groups according to their administrative status: county-level cities, prefecture-level cities and central municipalities. In 1993, for example, China had 371 county-level cities, 196 prefecture-level cities and 3 central municipalities. These numbers changed to 437, 227 and 4, respectively in 1998. Chongqing became the fourth central municipality in July 1997. Cities of different status are given different levels of authority such as investment decision-making and foreign-funded project approvals. The higher the level, the more directly the city reports to Beijing and the greater are its autonomy and influence. Usually, larger cities have higher administrative status. But there are some exceptions. For example, Xiamen in Fujian province is a quasi-province-level city but has a non- agricultural population (0.6 million in 1998) only about half of Fuzhou’s population (1.1 million in 1998). The latter is only a prefecture-level city, even though it is the capital of the province and has a much larger population (NBS, 1999). 
The definition of city in China is not straightforward. Chinese cities are administrative entities and must be officially designated, with designation criteria being a function of the political-administrative status, economic development, openness and total population of an urban place. Since upgrading status in the administrative hierarchy is usually accompanied by greater autonomy, political power and access to resources, local authorities are eager to pursue the upgrading of their settlements to a higher status (Fan, 1999). Such efforts, together with the relaxation of designation criteria, have brought a significant growth in China’s urban sector in the past two decades. Many county seats (xian cheng) have been reclassified as cities (shi), resulting in a sharp increase in the total number of cities, from 223 in 1980 to 667 in 1999. Some county seats earned city status even though they had a relatively small population. During the past two decades, many existing cities have been upgraded by expanding their territories or merging two adjacent cities or combining a city with its surrounding county. 
China also classifies its cities into five categories according to their size. Table 2 shows the definitions and the number of cities in each category in 1980 and 1999. In 1980, China had 7 super-large cities, 8 very large cities, 30 large cities, 72 medium cities and 106 small cities. These numbers increased to 13, 24, 49, 216 and 365 in 1999, respectively. These changes indicate a rapid urban growth in the past two decades. Table 2 also shows that most are small cities. In fact, the primacy and intercity concentration is relatively low in China. For example, the primacy measured by the share of the largest city’s population to the total urban population was only 4 per cent in 1998, compared with a primacy of 10 per cent for the US in 1990 based on urbanised area data. The urban population share of the top 10 largest cities in China was 19 per cent in 1998, compared with 37 per cent for the US in 1990 based on urbanised area data (US Bureau of Census, 1993). 
Does the Pareto law also provide an accurate description of Chinese city size distribution? To answer this question, we apply equation (1) to Chinese city systems in 1991 and 1998. The data are from the Urban Statistical Yearbook of China compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics of the PRC (NBS, 1992, 1999). This paper uses data on the non-agricultural population in urban areas (shi-qu). Although the time-gap between 1991 and 1998 might be small, it is interesting to see if there is any change in the Pareto exponent and thus a change in the pattern of Chinese city size distribution. Because city-level data are available only for 1991 and 1998, this paper is limited to these two years. 
Table 3 presents the results that are obtained by estimating a double-log model of equation (1) with the OLS method. Several interesting findings are observed. First, judging from the R values, it appears that the Pareto law explains Chinese city size distributions well. The adjusted R values are higher than 0.88 for both 1991 and 1998. 
Secondly, for the 1991 data, the estimated Pareto exponent is 0.92 with a standard deviation of 0.015, suggesting that the rank–size rule is statistically rejected estimated Pareto coefficient indicates that the size distribution of Chinese cities in 1991 is less even than that implied by the rank–size rule. For 1998 data, however, the estimated coefficient (1.04, with a standard deviation of 0.013) is statistically greater than 1, indicating that the city size distribution became more even than that predicted by the rank– size rule. 
Thirdly, the results show a significant increase in the Pareto exponent, from 0.92 in 1991 to 1.04 in 1998. This finding implies that the city size distribution in China became more even during 1991–98. The question here is what caused this change. Was it caused by the inclusion of many new cities in 1998 or by dynamic changes among the 1991 cities? To answer this question, we ran regressions by using data on cities common to both 1991 and 1998. As Table 3 shows, the estimated exponents based on the common sample become 0.92 for 1991 and 0.97 for 1998. Considering their standard deviations, we conclude that the latter is statistically greater than the former, suggesting that cities in the common sample became more evenly distributed between 1991 and 1998. We further notice that the estimated coefficient of the full 1998 sample (1.04) is statistically greater than that obtained by using the common sample (0.97). This finding suggests that the inclusion of new cities made cities in the full sample appear more evenly distributed. 
Some previous studies have shown that estimates of the Pareto exponent are sensitive to sample thresholds and size (Rosen and Resnick, 1980; Guerin-Pace, 1995). To examine whether this is also the case for China’s cities, we use various thresholds of low-end cut-offs in the 1998 city size distribution. Table 4 presents the results. It shows that the estimated Pareto exponent is sensitive to sample thresholds. In China’s case, the Pareto exponent increases with higher cut-off thresholds, at least within the range reported in Table 4. This finding suggests that the city size distribution is more even for large Chinese cities than for smaller cities. The rise in the Pareto exponent is also illustrated by the increase in the slope of fitted curves in Figure 1. Another interesting finding revealed in Table 4 is related to the fit of the Pareto law for different sample thresholds. As the last column shows, the R2 value increases until it reaches a maximum of 0.9968 at the threshold of 190 000. This result indicates that explanatory power of the Pareto law is also sensitive to sample thresholds. For the ‘right’ threshold, the law could appear superior in explaining Chinese city size distributions. 
These results show that both the Pareto exponent and fit vary with sample thresholds, revealing non-Pareto behaviour of the city size distribution. To confirm this non-Pareto behaviour, we added a quadratic term to the basic logarithmic version of equation (1), giving equation (2) 
Where
Table 5 shows the regression results. For both 1991 and 1998, we found that Chinese cities were not distributed according to the Pareto law (a linear regression model in logarithm). Non-Pareto behaviour is evident from the significance of the quadratic term in the regression. Compared with the results in Table 3, Table 5 also shows that the quadratic model fits the actual distributions much better than the Pareto law, with the adjusted R rising from 0.89 to 0.99 for 1991 and from 0.91 to 0.99 for 1998. Figure 2 shows the fitted curves for both the Pareto and the quadratic specifications. We observe that the quadratic curve fits the data points (i.e. the solid line) much better than the Pareto curve. The concave regression line implies that larger cities are more evenly distributed than smaller cities, confirming the rise in a as we restrict the sample to larger cities in Table 4 and Figure 1. 
We have seen that China has experienced a rapid urbanisation in the past two decades. A number of factors have promoted this. One is the relationship between industrialisation and urbanisation, as is well demonstrated in the literature on urban growth (for example, Henderson, 1988). Cities with a concentration of economic activities enjoy scale and agglomeration economies and continue to grow, primarily through rural–urban migration, until diseconomies become dominant. Since the economic reform started in the late 1970s, China has greatly upgraded its economic structure. In 1978, 70.5 per cent of employed persons were in the agricultural (primary) sector, which contributed 28 per cent to the national GDP (NBS, 2000, pp. 54 and 116). In 1999, these proportions decreased to 50 per cent and 18 per cent respectively. Industrialisation and the upgrading of China’s economic structure have created a great number of job opportunities in urban areas and have absorbed a large number of rural surplus workers, thus promoting China’s urbanisation. 
Rural– urban migration in recent years is another important factor contributing to city growth in China. Before urban reforms started in 1984, China had a long policy that strictly limited rural– urban migration through a static urban household registration system. Under this system, rural people were not entitled to urban employment or to state subsidies in housing, food, fuel, medical care and school. Without employment and state subsidies, rural workers could not survive in urban areas. The urban reforms since 1984 have relaxed restrictions on migration in many ways. For example, enterprises in urban areas have become more autonomous in hiring and firing their workers, and the former ‘iron-bowl’ employment system has been replaced by a labour contract system. Hence, many enterprises prefer to hire rural workers because of their lower labour costs. Other institutional changes have also facilitated rural– urban migration. For instance, housing has been delinked with employment, rationing of food and fuel has been abandoned and the urban household registration system is being gradually phased out. As a result, China has been experiencing a huge influx of rural workers into urban areas. In 1998, 44 million rural workers left their homeland to seek jobs somewhere else (NBS, 1999b). According to Liu (2000), between 2.3 to 2.7 million rural workers migrated to cities each year in the late 1990s. Chen and Parish (1996) found that about one-fifth of the entrants in the urban labour force came from rural areas.
China’s open-door policy has also promoted China’s urbanisation. Specifically, foreign direct investment (FDI) has been a key force driving the recent coastal city growth and urbanisation in east China. In the period of 1986– 98, China attracted over US$260 billion of FDI, with 87.7 per cent locating in the coastal region. The role of FDI in urban economic development and thus urbanisation can be observed in several aspects. First, FDI directly promotes exports. According to Zhang and Song (2000), the share of foreign-invested enterprises’ (FIEs) exports in China’s total exports increased from a negligible proportion (0.05 per cent) in 1980 to 12.6 per cent in 1990 and to 45.5 per cent in 1999. Secondly, FDI indirectly affects exports because local domestic firms may increase their exports by observing the export activities of FIEs and FIEs improve the linkage between local and foreign firms. Thirdly, FDI creates jobs. Song (2000) found that FDI has become a more important contributor to the creation of urban employment. In 1985, FIEs employed 0.13 million workers, accounting for only 0.1 per cent of total urban employment. In 1998, FIEs’ employment reached 5.9 million workers, accounting for 3.8 per cent of total urban employment. The experience of Shenzhen, the first special economic zone in China, is a good demonstration of FDI’s role in promoting China’s urbanisation. In the 8 years between 1991 and 1998, the population of Shenzhen increased by 165 per cent, from 432 000 to 1 146 000. Each year during this period, data used in this paper show that per capita FDI for Shenzhen was far greater than the average per capita FDI for all Chinese cities. It is evident that FDI has indeed promoted China’s city growth and urbanisation. 
China’s city system exhibits the profound impacts of institutional factors. One important institutional factor is the government’s development strategy. As several previous studies have argued, Chinese leaders have always attempted to control the growth of the large cities and to limit severely rural–urban migration (Hsu, 1996; Fan, 1999). Before the economic reform, Chinese urban policy emphasised the growth of heavy industries. Cities were narrowly viewed as potential sites of industrial plants, and favoured cities were assigned a number of large state-owned heavy industrial enterprises. Such an urban development strategy discouraged the growth of light and service industries in most cities, thus unnecessarily restricting their economic base and limiting employment growth. In addition, the Chinese government was very concerned with coastal security. Because of this concern, China carried out the ‘three-front’ project in the 1950s and 1960s. Many strategic manufacturing plants were moved inland from the coastal region. New industrial cities were built far from the coastline and the government sent many workers and technical personnel to these new cities. Hsu (1996) analysed city development in Luoyang and Guiyang and found that early government decisions had had a lasting impact on city growth. Hsu showed that government economic policies and urban directives of the 1950s have been critical determinants of the development of Chinese cities, not just in that decade, but also for many years subsequently. 
China’s current urban policy still favours the development of small cities. The official urban policy is to “control large cities, develop medium-sized cities rationally, and actively develop small cities”. This urban policy, however, has been challenged by scholars. For example, Zhao and Zhang (1995) showed that there is a high positive correlation between city efficiency and city size, not only in economic but also in social and environmental terms. Hong and Chen (2000) studied cities in Jiangsu province and found that small cities are at a disadvantage with respect to the provision of urban infrastructure. They argued that a certain consumption scale and population size are necessary conditions for promoting service industries and markets. Song (2001) used 1997 city-level data and showed that larger cities tend to have lower unemployment rates. As far as employment is concerned, job creation is associated with urban size. Product variety in production and consumption is related to urban size; variety, in turn, requires labour specialisation, thus creating jobs (Abdel-Rahman and Fujita, 1990; Ogawa, 1998). 
China’s city system has also been affected by migration policy. Until the late 1990s, China had strictly limited rural-to-urban migration, especially to large cities. Thus, the anti-migration policy not only slowed down the pace of China’s urbanisation, but also affected the structure of China’s city system because China limited migration to larger cities more strictly than to smaller cities. 
China’s urbanisation has experienced three phases. The pace of urban growth during the first period, from 1952 to 1965, was fast. Anti-urbanisation, however, prevailed during the Cultural Revolution and the urban population share stagnated at about 18 per cent from 1965 to 1978. Rapid urbanisation started with the economic reform in 1978 and has continued since then, with the urban population share steadily increasing to nearly 31 per cent in 1999. 
Based on 1991 and 1998 city-level data, we find that Chinese cities became more evenly distributed in the 1990s. We also find that the Pareto law fits Chinese data well, although China’s city system exhibits some non-Pareto behaviour statistically. The empirical results of the Pareto exponent are consistent with earlier findings that populous countries tend to have more evenly distributed cities. 
Several major economic and institutional factors have contributed to the rapid urban growth and changes in the urban system in the past two decades. The recent industrialisation of China’s economy has created many job opportunities in cities. This, along with relaxation of many rural–urban migration restrictions, has resulted in a huge influx of rural workers into cities. The open-door policy and foreign direct investment have also helped China to become more urbanised, especially in the coastal areas. All these changes have affected not only the total urban population, but also the distribution of sizes of Chinese cities.
