The Moroccan urban system has a long and rich history, with four classes of cities: large, important ancient cities (Fes, Marrakech, Sale, Tetouan, and Meknes); small to medium ancient cities (Sefrou, Midlet, Taroudant, and Bejed); large but not ancient cities (Casablanca, Kenitra, and Agadir); and small to medium but not ancient cities (BeniMellal, Settat, and Ouarzazate)(Bahdoud, 2012, p. 66). The long urban history of Morocco has been instrumental in developing the more even distribution of cities over its territory, as is observed in other countries with more balanced urban patterns (Berry, 1961, p. 575). 
During the 20th century, the Moroccan urban system underwent a deep transformation. By 2004, more than 55% of the Moroccan population was living in urban centers, compared to 8% at the onset of the 20th century. This urban population lives in a network of cities dispersed all over the Moroccan territory, with a slight concentration along the Atlantic coastal corridor spanning from Kenitra to Eljadida. The low rate of urban population at the beginning of the 20th century was a result of epidemics, plagues, and famines that occurred mainly in the North of Morocco and in its important cities during the 18th century (Elbezzaz, 1992, p. 56, p. 62). 
This paper constitutes an attempt to test the validity of the rank-size rule in the context of the Moroccan urban system. The objective is to empirically explore the hierarchy and to describe the distribution patterns of cities according to their size. The Zipf-law or the rank-size rule is used to describe the overall patterns of an urban system by a synthetic figure. It is important to recall that the validity of the rank-size rule is a highly debated topic among economists, urbanists, network scientists, geographers, and other social science scholars (Duranton, 2012, p. 18). Gabaix noted, “Zipf’s law for cities is one of the most conspicuous empirical facts in economics, or in the social sciences generally” (Gabaix, 1999a, p. 1). Krugman (1996) qualified the ubiquity of this law in different countries and different times as a mystery. 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In the second section, we present some simple mathematics of Zipf’s law and its links/philology with the family of power or Pareto laws. In the third section, we review papers that explored the validity of Zipf’s law in other countries. The fourth section presents some features related to the Moroccan urban system. The fifth section presents the data and results. The sixth section discusses the results. The last section contains some concluding remarks. 
In many areas, we are confronted with entities captured by a certain magnitude, however measured. For instance, in comparing urban areas we use factors such as population and gross domestic product. In linguistics, we consider the frequency of each word in a linguistic corpus. In geology, the diameter or the weight of grains of sand or the intensity of earthquakes are considered. In economics, we are interested in the size of firms measured by factors such as the volume of their sales and number of employees. After collecting data on the elements of a system or population, we are concerned with the ordering of the objects and the hierarchy that emerges; that is, their pattern of distribution according to the scalar measuring their intensity. Usually, we compare the observed pattern to a theoretical model. 
Let Sr be the size of the rth largest city. Here, size is measured by the population of the city. The subscript, r, is the rank of the city of size Sr. Therefore, S1 is the size of the largest city, S2 is the size of the second largest city, and so on. Obviously, in an urban system comprising n cities we have 1 r n. We want to model the distribution of cities according to their size. Empirically, the proportion of cities with size S larger or equal to Sr is r/n. This means that the empirical proportion of cities sized greater than or equal to Sr is. Indeed, from the n cities forming the given urban system, r cities have a size superior or equal to Sr. The proportion of cities with populations lower than Sr is. 
A random variable, X, is said to follow a power law if the probability that X takes a value equal or greater than x is equal to. The exponent k > 0 is the Pareto shape parameter and m is a constant, such as. The probability that X is strictly below x is given by. This last expression is the cumulative distribution function. The density probability function of X, denoted by f(x) is given by differentiating FX(x) with respect to x. That is, we have: 
The probability density function written in Equation 1 is the well-known power law with exponent. Concerning, it is a non-remarkable constant which is data dependent. In 1949, Zipf formulated a proposition about the link between the rank of a city and its size. Since that time, this conjecture has been known as Zipf’s law, but is also known as the rank-size rule in urban economics literature. Zipf’s law states that the rank r of the city of size Sr is proportional to with an exponent a equal to -1. In a general case where a is not constrained to be equal to one, we have. If we transform to logarithms, we obtain the following: 
Consequently, in a log–log plot of city rank and size we find a straight line, which is the signature of a power law. For a zipfian urban system, the slope a should be practically equal to -1; in this case we say that the rank-size rule is validated. The t-test is used to decide if the value of the exponent a is equal to -1 or not (Nishiyama et al., 2008, p. 692). 
The exponent a measures the inequality between the elements of the urban system. Otherwise, it indicates the hierarchy of/between cities in a country, a region, or any geographic area. Indeed, a small a implies that the urban system is highly concentrated and the largest cities dominate with few medium or small cities. As the exponent increases, more small and medium cities are found in the urban system. This implies less hierarchy, that is, more equality between cities.
There is abundant literature on the rank-size rule. Duranton (2012), Gabaix and Ioannides (2003), and Schaffar (2009) discussed theoretical aspects. Rosen and Resnick (1980), Volker (2004), and Soo (2005) focused on the empirical validity of the rank-size rule in cross-country studies. In this section, we review only a very limited sample of empirical literature. 
Rosen and Resnick (1980) published one of the most cited papers regarding the size distribution of cities. They explored how cities are distributed according to their size and the extent of primacy in 44 countries. In 32 countries, the authors documented a Pareto exponent higher than one. “That indicates that populations in most countries are more evenly distributed than would be predicted by the rank-size rule (Pareto exponent = 1)” (Rosen &Resnick, 1980, p. 166). For the 44 countries, it is found that the Pareto exponent is negatively correlated to the primacy measure. Rosen and Resnick (1980) warned readers “that [the] value of Pareto exponent is quite sensitive to definition of the city and choice of sample size” (p. 184). The paper documented a deviation of the city-size distribution from the Pareto distribution because of the sign and significance of the quadratic term added to log(Sr) and to the constant to explain log(r). Rosen and Resnick found an upward concavity in more than two-thirds of their sample of 44 countries. The authors explained this result by the probable faster growth of large cities compared to the growth of small ones. 
Soo (2005) explored a sample of 73 countries using ordinary least squares (OLS) and Hill estimators. The results show that, using the OLS method, rank-size rule is accepted in 20 countries. When Soo used the Hill estimator, the number of countries where rank-size rule was validated jumped to 43. Furthermore, Soo attempted to explain the value of the hierarchization coefficient “a” by some exogenous factors. “a” is called Pareto exponent and, as noted in footnote 1, it serves to characterize the hierarchization of a system. For this reason, we call it also hierarchization coefficient. His main result was that political economy variables are more relevant than geography variables in explaining the value of the hierarchization coefficient. 
Guerin-Pace (1995) examined the long-run dynamics of the French urban system over the period spanning 1831–1990 using data of 28 censuses. This is a rather long period to detect the possible persistent phenomena characterizing urban dynamics in a system of cities. The author used Lotka’s formulation where the population S is regressed on the rank, and found an increasing inequality in the French urban system that “slowed down or stopped between 1926 and 1954, and then shows a clear upturn since 1975”(Guerin-Pace, 1995, p. 555). As with Rosen and Resnick (1980), the author introduced a non-linear term in Equation 2. He found time varying behavior within three periods. During the first period (1831–1896), there was a downward concavity. The second period, beginning at the end of the first period and “which lasted until 1936, shows values of c close to zero, and reflects good abidance to the law of Pareto” (Guerin-Pace, 1995, p. 558). The coefficient c measures the nonlinearity of the link between city size and rank. Finally, in the third period, the values of parameter c were negative, and stress an overturn in the shape of the distribution – that is, the number of middle- sized class have become greater than what Pareto’s law predicted. 
Knudsen (2001) explored the validity of the rank-size rule in Denmark. He used a dataset containing the 61 largest Danish cities in the year 2000. His main result was the validation of the rank-size rule. The hierarchization coefficient was equal to a = -1.056. The goodness of fit coefficient R2 was equal to 0.962, which proves a rather good fit. 
Using the data of 135 larger cities in 1991, Gabaix (1999a, b) proved the validity of the rank-size rule in the case of the United States. The Zipf’s coefficient was equal to -1.005. The log(size)-log(rank) plot was a rather perfect line, with an R2 equal to 0.986. Gabaix (1999a) attempted to explain the processes that generate this regularity, widely documented in economics, linguistics, and Internet studies. In a similar study of the US, using 2000 data for a sample of the 135 largest cities of more than 155554 people, Eeckhout (2004, p. 1441) found a hierarchization coefficient equal to a = -1.354. 
Giesen and Suedekum (2009) explored the validity of rank-size rule for the German case in 1997. Their data concerned cities at the national level and 20 cities of each of eight German regions. The authors estimated the rank-size distribution by OLS method with and without the Gabaix-Ibragimov correction (GIC) (2011). The data included 2143 urban centers, and the authors worked on a sample of 71 cities of more than 100000 inhabitants. The main result was that the coefficient a was practically equal to unity for Germany as a whole and for each of its eight regions. This is equivalent to say that rank-size rule “appears to hold everywhere in space, that is for each region regardless of how it is defined” (Giesen and Suedekum, 2009, p. 10, italics in origin). 
Ancient Moroccan cities (Sale, Fez, Marrakech) were established near rivers as they were sources of water. More recent and fast growing cities emerged because of their proximity to other amenities, such as the port in Casablanca, phosphate ore in Khouribga, and the absence of concurrent cities in Nador. This transformation from the natural factors of agglomeration to more human factors (e.g. economics, politics) of agglomeration is also observable in other countries. 
Although numerous Moroccan urban centers have been established for a very long time, the urban Moroccan population represented only 8% of the total population at the beginning of the 20th century. During a period of one century, the urban population attained 55% of the total population, passing from 400000 inhabitants (8% in the begining of the 20th century, the figure for 2004 is 15 800 000.) to 15 million and 800000 inhabitants (55%) in 2004 (HCP, 1999, p. 67; HCP’s census for 2004). Thus, Morocco underwent transformation from a rural to an urban country in the space of one century. To have an understanding of the speed, the same urban transformation that occurred in Morocco over 30 years (1920–1950) occurred in France over 150 years (1700–1850) (Ecochard, 1951; p. 30). When compared with South Korea, it appears that this country had been urbanized much more quickly than Morocco (see Fig.1). 
The fast growth of the Moroccan urban population (UP) resulted from four factors common all over the world (Bloom et al., 2008, p. 9): the organic increase of the urban population; rural migration; the spread of existing cities to surrounding areas, automatically making their inhabitants urban (here, it is important to recall that 30% of buildings in cities are constructed on rural areas surrounding cities, Mondiale, 2008, p. 9); and the reclassification of rural centers into urban areas (HCP, 1999, p. 71). The consequence of these factors is the increasing number of urban entities with a population of more than 5 000 inhabitants (see Fig. 2). 
Globally, the Moroccan population increases at a rate that is continuously decreasing. Another feature of the dynamics of the Moroccan population is the slow growth of its rural component compared to the growth rate of its urban component, especially since the beginning of the 1970s. Around the mid 1990s, the urban exceeded the rural population (see Fig. 3). 
The fact that the urban share of total Moroccan population exceeded 50% in the first half of the 1990s is because of its more rapid rate of growth compared with the rate of growth of the rural population. Indeed, from 1982–1994, the urban population increased at an annual average rate of 3.65%, whereas the rural population increased at a pace of 0.67%. It is evident that the higher growth rate of the urban population was not only a result of natural causes, but was mainly fueled by rural migration (Puschmann, 2009, p.72). This is evident if we know that the fecundity rate in urban areas is significantly inferior to the fecundity rate in rural areas. People are born in rural areas and migrate to urban ones (HCP, 2010, p. 71). Figure 3 depicts the evolution of total, urban, and rural population over one century in Morocco. 
Our intent was to explore the form of the distribution of Moroccan cities according to their size. We used three datasets of Moroccan urban centers: 1982, 1994, and 2004. Observing the Moroccan urban system over the period 1982–2004 sheds light on structural transformations, such as rural migration and the organic increase of the size of existing cities, transforming Morocco into a country with a predominantly urban population. 
In 2004, the Moroccan population was 29680069 inhabitants. Fifty-five percent of this population lived in 332 urban centers; 232 centers had more than 5000 inhabitants (see maps in annex C). It appears that the urban centers were dispersed all over the Moroccan territory, with a visual concentration along the coastal area, specifically near the primary city, Casablanca. The Moroccan urban system is concentrated in a corridor spanning from Kenitra to Eljadida on the Atlantic coast. Thus, 43.14% of the Moroccan urban population in 1982, 35.85% in 1994, and 33.37% in 2004 was clustered in this area of almost 220 km. Furthermore, the largest Moroccan city, Casablanca, is located in this area, comprising 26.45% of the urban population in 1982, 20.40% in 1994, and 18.05% in 2004. In this paper, we only examined urban centers of more than 5 000 inhabitants. 
An astonishing pattern in Morocco is that in two major cities, Casablanca and Rabat, population growth rates are below the growth rate of the Moroccan urban population. The population of the 10 largest cities represented 61%, 58%, and 53% of the total Moroccan urban population in 1982, 1994, and 2004, respectively. However, the 10 largest cities included 19%, 29%, and 29% of the total Moroccan population in 1982, 1994, and 2004, respectively. This indicates that the population of the largest 10 cities grew more rapidly than the growth rate of the total population, but less rapidly than the growth rate of the total urban population. 
Studies of the hierarchy and organization of the Moroccan urban system using the rank- size rule are scarce. Catin et al. (2008) study the period 1950–2000. Contrary to the majority of researchers, Catin et al. simulated the following regression using the OLS method with data from the United Nations database. Their results are summarized in Table 1. 
Catin et al.’s (2008) results reveal a trend of less hierarchization of the Moroccan urban system. The Pareto coefficient decreased gradually, attaining a value of 1.23 in 2000.The authors explained distribution of the more even urban system by the more rapid growth of small and medium cities, compared to the growth of large ones (Catin et al., 2008, p. 221). It appears that the growing cost of agglomeration causes a redirection of migration to second-tier cities (small and medium cities) as a result of the delocalization of low skill activities, in turn, caused by the fact that these activities’ competitiveness is mainly based on the low cost of labor (Catin et al., 2008, p. 220). 
In his empirical study of 73 countries using only the data of the 10 largest cities, Soo estimated the hierarchization coefficient for Morocco. He found a equal to -1.104 for 1982 (Soo, 2005, p. 246). This is indicative of the validity of the rank-size rule in the Moroccan case for the upper tail. For 1994, Soo found a hierarchization coefficient a equal to -0.873 for a sample of 59 Moroccan cities. On the other hand, Rosen and Resnick (1980) found the hierarchization coefficient a in the case of the Moroccan urban system in 1971 was the lowest, equal to -0.809. This means that the Moroccan urban system is less equally distributed among the 44 countries analyzed by the authors. 
As already discussed, we sought to determine if rank-size rule is useful to describe the hierarchy of the Moroccan urban system. For this, we regress the log of the rank of each city on the log of its size. That is, we used the OLS method with GIC to simulate Equation 2. 
Figure 4 shows the log(rank)-log(size) plot data of cities in 1982, 1994, and 2004, for three different minimum city size thresholds. Table 2 summarizes the results concerning the three years with the different thresholds. The estimation of a was performed using the OLS method with and without GIC (2011). This correction exists to run equation, in order to reduce the bias of the OLS procedure in estimating the tail index a, especially in small samples. Thereby, Gabaix and Ibragimov “provide a simple approach to bias reduction based on the modified log-log rank-size regression. The shift of 1/2 is optimal and reduces the bias to a leading order” (Gabaix and Ibragimov, 2011, p. 30). As shown in Table 2, the difference between the measured coefficients of hierarchization by the two methods is significant. The measures of skewness are 8.38, 8.21, and 9.21 for the entire sample in the censuses 1982, 1994, and 2004, respectively; it appears that the distribution of Moroccan cities according to their size is skewed to the right and very leptokurtic, which means that the tail is longer and flatter. 
Table 2 shows that when we use the OLS method without GIC, the coefficient of hierarchization is inferior to one, regardless of the threshold or year. This result is similar to Rosen and Resnick’s (1980) concerning Morocco using 1971 data. The t-test, using the OLS method without GIC, provides evidence in favor of the validity of the rank-size rule for cities of more than 100 000 inhabitants. Globally, if we take all Moroccan cities with more than 5 000 inhabitants, the hierarchization coefficient approaches unity using 1982–2004 census data. Guerin-Pace obtained similar results regarding the French urban system, studied over a lengthier period. Our result differs from Benguigui and Blumenfeld-Lieberthal’s (2007), who found a hierarchization coefficient for Morocco in 2004 of 1.11, but without introducing the most populated city. The authors “chose countries with no less than 18 cities or agglomerations larger than 100,000 inhabitants”(p. 650). Using OLS with GIC, the t-test provides evidence that the rank-size rule is valid (a = -1) for cities of more than 50 000 residents. 
We believe that the Moroccan urban system is not yet stable. One element in favor of our finding is the fact that cities were very differently ranked according to their size in the three censuses of 1982, 1992, and 2004. The same was observed by Madden (1956) in the US urban system during the two centuries preceding his study. The author documented that“considerable fluctuation has occurred among the ranks of individual cities” over these two centuries (p. 242). 
In the near future, cities such as Rabat, Sale, Temara, and Tamesna will constitute unique agglomerations. Many authors already consider such urban spaces as unique entities. Although many indicators provide signs that the Moroccan urban system is not yet stable, some elements indicate that it is on the edge of stabilization. If the size of a city is small, then any increment of thousands of people to its initial population significantly changes its ranking. Furthermore, it appears that medium cities grow more rapidly than small and large cities, as depicted in Figure 5. 
As authors before us (Rosen &Resnick, 1980; Guerin-Pace, 1995), we introduced a quadratic term in Equation 2 to detect any departure of the city size distribution from the Pareto distribution. The coefficient b in this adjusted equation measured the weight of large cities compared to intermediate ones. Thus, we ran this regression. Table A3 summarizes our results concerning b estimates for the three years and the three thresholds. 
The coefficient b of the quadratic term is systematically negative, indicating a downward concavity of the curve linking size and rank. Therefore, medium-sized cities are overrepresented in the Moroccan urban system comparative to what is expected by a Pareto distribution. This is concordant with the fact that intermediate cities are growing more rapidly than larger ones (see Fig. 4). This characteristic is more acute for cities of 100000 or more inhabitants for which the downward concavity is more pronounced. Consequently, in this class of cities, the upper tail does not dominate. It is worth noting that the t-test indicates that b is practically equal to 0. The same result was found by Rosen and Resnick (1980, p. 177) for Morocco using 1971 census data. However, we did not consider the cautions advised by Nishiyama et al. (2008, p. 702) concerning the irregular behavior of the t-statistics in similar situations. 
The development of satellite cities of the main city (the centrality) is a factor that will radically transform the hierarchy of cities and paradoxically stabilize the Moroccan urban system. One of the outcomes of the development of satellite adjacent cities is the emergence of conurbations, such as Rabat, Casablanca, Agadir, and Tangier. It is important to note that when we use the agglomeration as an urban unit and the OLS method to run Equation 2, we find that the rank-size rule is far from being validated with a Pareto exponent below one, indicating higher concentration compared to when the unit considered is a city (see Table B1, appendix). However, it seems that the rank-size rule is valid for agglomerations of more than 100000 dwellers when we use OLS with GIC. 
One of the salient outcomes regarding the ranking of cities according to their size is the change in the ranks of many cities. The change in ranking reveals a decline in cities that are in the direct environment of great cities, with the exception of cities in the direct neighborhood of Rabat. Cities in the south of Morocco gain in ranking. This may be explained by the fact that a centrality (a mega city) is more likely to attract potential migrants, resulting in the decline of its satellites cities, or their absorption. 
In this paper we explored the form of the distribution of Moroccan cities, according to their size. We used data from the three censuses of 1982, 1994, and 2004. For each year, we computed the hierarchization coefficient of the three sets of cities: cities of more than 5000, 50000, and 100000 residents. For cities of more than 100000, the coefficient of hierarchization was between -0.96 and -0.91. For this class of cities, the t-test does not reject the null hypothesis that a = -1. When we use GIC, the zipfian distribution (a = -1) becomes valid for all cities of more than 50000 inhabitants. 
Table B1 (Annex B in the appendix) summarizes the results when we consider a city and its satellite cities as one agglomeration. We used the OLS method with GIC to simulate Equation 2. The a for the upper tail of cities is very close to -1. The t-test shows that for agglomerations of more than 100000 dwellers, the rank-size rule is a good model to describe the hierarchy of Moroccan cities. Many questions remain unanswered concerning the Moroccan urban system; therefore, further research is required in order to deepen our understanding of its dynamics and trends.
